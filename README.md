# AI and LLMs in Education Research

## Overview

This repository contains the research work conducted on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) on education. The research focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in improving student engagement and academic performance across diverse educational settings.

## Motivation

After conducting extensive research in the field of AI and large language models, the researcher chose to investigate the impact of AI and LLMs on education. The decision was motivated by a genuine interest in the field and a belief in the transformative potential of AI and LLMs in shaping the future of education.

## Research Objectives

The primary research objective is to assess the effectiveness of AI and LLMs in improving student engagement and academic performance. Specific areas of focus include the accuracy of these models, potential mistakes or false statements, and the impact on students' overall educational abilities.

## Methodology

The researcher proposes two main experiments for data collection. The first involves a controlled study with two groups of 20 people each, where one group has free access to AI and LLMs models, and the other does not. Questions related to their area of study will be assessed, along with the time taken to complete tasks. The second experiment involves groups preparing for an exam, with one group having access to LLMs and the other without, to measure the impact on overall educational abilities.

## Ethical Considerations

The researcher acknowledges the ethical and bias concerns associated with LLMs, as they are trained on human data that may contain biases. The research aims to address these concerns and contribute to a better understanding of potential biases in educational contexts.

## Contribution

The findings of this research aim to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing educational revolution. The goal is to provide information for teachers, policymakers, and tech developers, empowering decision-makers with knowledge and strategies to seamlessly integrate AI and LLMs into the educational landscape.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this research explores the impact of AI and LLMs on education, considering their benefits, limitations, and ethical concerns. Through controlled experiments and addressing these issues, the research aims to provide insights that drive positive change in educational and technology practices.
